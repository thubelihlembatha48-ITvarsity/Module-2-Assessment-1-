                    <h3>Wild Things Coffee Shop</h3>
                    <p>Set in a beautiful garden full of nature and wild life. A good place to chat and relax with friends. Simple food here with secret but non-allegies ingridients on the sandwiches. The scones are lovely and well presented and ofcourse the coffee is out of this world.</p>
                    <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                    <p>Wild things coffee shop is near the main food court and also near the lost forest.</p>
